# Retail-data-analysis-with-Python



## 📝 Description

This project focuses on performing comprehensive retail data analysis using Python. Leveraging industry-standard libraries, the analysis aims to extract actionable insights from raw retail data. While specific features and tech stack details are not currently provided, the project's core objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies within retail datasets to support data-driven decision-making. Future iterations will detail the specific analytical techniques applied (e.g., sales forecasting, customer segmentation), the libraries employed (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and the key performance indicators (KPIs) tracked. Stay tuned for updates detailing the project's progression and findings.
